# SnoozeTabs

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/bwinton/SnoozeTabs.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/bwinton/SnoozeTabs)

An add-on to let you snooze your tabs for a while.

## How to run
* `npm install`

* To develop: `npm start`
  * This task does 3 things:
    1. Builds the extension
    1. Starts a file watcher to rebuild on changes
    1. Runs tests on file changes
  * You can load the Web Extension into Firefox like so:
    1. Type `about:debugging` into the URL bar - [read more about this page on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/about:debugging).
    1. Click the "Load Temporary Add-on" button
    1. Navigate to your Snooze Tabs project directory and select `dist/manifest.json`

* To run once: `npm run build && npm run run`

* To build for release: `npm run build`

* To lint: `npm run lint`

* To work with a production-style release, set the env var `NODE_ENV=production`.
  This will turn on production optimizations, while turning off logging &
  various development conveniences. For example:
  * Continuous file watcher builds:
    * `NODE_ENV=production npm start`
  * Single one-shot build:
    * `NODE_ENV=production npm run build`

## Architectural Questions / Decisions…

* Spec?
  * At [this link][spec].
* Assets?
  * Coming soon.
* Should we write this as a [WebExtension][webext]?
  * YES!

* Add a “Developer Mode” with much shorter times, or an extra 3-second timer?
* We’ll need something to convert [Pontoon][pontoon]-format l10n files into [WebExtension l10n][l10n] files…

## Localization

Snooze Tabs localization is managed via [Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/projects/test-pilot-snoozetabs/), not direct pull requests to the repository. If you want to fix a typo, add a new language, or simply know more about localization, please get in touch with the [existing localization team](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/teams/) for your language, or Mozilla’s [l10n-drivers](https://wiki.mozilla.org/L10n:Mozilla_Team#Mozilla_Corporation) for guidance.
